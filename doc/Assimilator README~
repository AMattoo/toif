ASSIMILATOR
============

The assimilator merges TOIF findings into a common fact-orientated repository or file.

============

To run the assimilator, execute the assimilator script on the command line, specifying the repository location and the files to merge.

assimilator.sh -r <path to repository> [-p project root]<files or directories to merge>

	-k	The -k option can be used instead of -r to specify a .kdm file. The .kdm files are generally more mobile then a repository.
	-p  The optional root name that start paths from this common directory name.
